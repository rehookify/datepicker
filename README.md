## Features

- Small in size.
- No dependencies.
- [Modular design](/datepicker/modular-hooks): You can use as little code as possible.
- Supports single, multiple, and range date selection, as well as a time picker.
- Multiple calendar support.
- Native localization support using *.toLocaleDateString* and *.toLocaleTimeString*.
- Follows the `prop-getters` pattern, providing all the necessary props for your components.

## Motivation

By picking a date picker for you project you can get such problems:

- 🙅 your component library doesn't have the component that you need;
- ⚙️ you need to make changes to your build process;
- 💅 your styling system is different from the most popular solution;
- 🦹 it's challenging to customise a component that matches your design;
- 💰 it could cost money to get needed components;
- 🏋️ the library is heavy and doesn't have tree-shaking;
- 📚 bad documentation;
- ⛔️ no tests, no TypeScript support, no examples...
